# Obstacle-Avoidance-Robot-Control-with-Ultrasonic-Sensors
This C++ code controls a robot using three ultrasonic sensors and four motors. It makes the robot move forward, turn left, or turn right based on the distance measurements from the sensors to avoid obstacles. If an obstacle is too close, the robot stops; otherwise, it continues moving or adjusts direction to navigate around obstacles.
